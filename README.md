# PyBoop

BOOP!

This is a layer built on top of Pyglet which will provide a lot of services to
fascilitate the creation of several kinds of 2d video games (level loading,
tile-based worlds, loading and staging, menu systems, useful drawables, etc).

Currently it provides a more easily tapable event framework, and some useful
tools for structuring a game in the traditional object-oriented manner, in
addition to a start on the drawables and a shader framework which is a WIP.

Development is following along with my uses in other projects primarily.
